# Static site framework

This website was made using a static site framework. The framework creates static html from markdown, utilizing mustache templates and sass for styles. It's designed to be simple enough to be comfy and easy to debug. There's a github action that builds the site when changes are pushed to main. This way one can add and edit articles with minimal effort, while still having basic formatting options available.
