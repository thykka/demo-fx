# Static site framework

This website was made using a custom [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator). It is designed to be comfy and simple to use.

The framework creates static html from [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), utilizing [mustache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_\(template_system\)) templates and [sass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_\(style_sheet_language\)) for styles.

There's a [GitHub action](https://github.com/thykka/demo-fx/blob/main/.github/workflows/static.yml) that builds the site when changes are pushed to main. This way one can add and edit articles with minimal effort, while still having basic formatting options available.

And if you're wondering; no, this hasn't got anything to do with demos. It's just a placeholder page I put up while *preparing* to write about demos :-D
